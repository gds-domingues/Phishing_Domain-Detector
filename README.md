# Phishing_Domain-Detector
This project aims to detect potential phishing domains by analyzing various characteristics of the domain, such as its registration date and similarity to known legitimate domains. The script uses Python libraries to extract domain information, perform WHOIS lookups, and compare domains to detect suspicious activity.
